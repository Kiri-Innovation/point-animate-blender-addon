## Introduction:
The add-on allows you to animate scans or models by applying custom Geometry Nodes animation modifiers, enabling users to achieve VFX and motion graphic results without requiring any prior animation experience.

Designed for beginners, it lets you create animations with as few as five clicks.
For more experienced users, full control over each modifier is provided, with the option to layer them for more complex effects.

The addon is inspired by the point cloud animations of Ruben Fro and mv.nyc: with that in mind, presets are designed to convert solid meshes into point clouds. But for greater versatility, mesh objects can also be animated with ease.

## Installation:
❗❗Please note❗❗ The addon was made for the most current version of Blender at the time of writing. The addon should be capable of 4.2 and later, and will NOT work with previous versions of Blender.
