These demo files have been created using the Point Animate addon by KIRI Engine

To get the best use out of these files - install the addon, before opening and playing with each file.

The file 'Point Animate - Demo - Anatomy Text' also makes use of our free addon '3DGS Render by KIRI Engine'

But it isn't fully required to open/view the file contents.
